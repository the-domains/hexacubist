# About this website

This website is a place for me to host various projects of mine that are too small to deserve their own domain but are cool enough to be public. I also do web development, and some of the sites I've worked on may end up here from time to time. Other projects that don't involve html (such as a series of gaming events I run) will also be posted here. Essentially this is a portal, generic portfolio and placeholder website rolled into one.
