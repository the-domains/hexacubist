Back in May 2016 I was tasked with redesigning and building the new website for the local company [Alliance Media][0]. The Brief was to create a website which was both professional as well as open and vibrant.

In order to achieve this, the home page design uses hard blocks of color in a symmetrical grid layout. These key blocks allow for the user to find content in its expected place without being disinteresting.

To make the site vibrant, the content is centered on the page and fixed in front of a large landscape photo. The "hero" title area's content block is transparent, and in doing so acts as a larger window onto the photo in the background.

Use of the company's primary orange color on specific words emphasizes the key points of the site, and has a secondary purpose of making the site more vibrant.

Outside of the homepage, the site takes a more consistent approach to layouting content. Once people navigate off of the homepage, they are often looking for a specific piece of information, and so special layouts should take a back seat to the information on the page.

On pages (such as the [portfolio][1]), portfolio items are placed in a responsive masonry gallery, stacking the items so that the odd proportions of the images do not leave unused whitespace:
